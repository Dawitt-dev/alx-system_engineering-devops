Simple web stack:

A server is a powerful computer responsible for storing data, running applications, and providing services to other computers (clients) over a network. In the context of web infrastructure, it serves as the host for the entire system.In this simple stack the server is composed of a linux operating system, an Apache websrver (NGinx),a MYSQL database and an app server(with a pyhton codebase) making it a LAMP stack.

The domain name (www.foobar.com) acts as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address, making it more user-friendly for accessing the website.

The DNS record for www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, pointing www to the domain's main record, aiding in aliasing and management.

The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests, serving static content and acting as a reverse proxy to forward dynamic requests to the application server.

The application server executes application code, manages business logic, and generates dynamic content, communicating with the database (MySQL) to retrieve or store data.

For communication with the user's computer requesting the website, the server uses HTTP or its secure version, HTTPS, facilitated through the web server (Nginx).

Regarding issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The entire setup relies on a single server, risking inaccessibility if it fails. Addressing this may involve redundant servers, load balancing, or a more distributed architecture.

Downtime during maintenance: Deploying new code or performing maintenance requires web server restarts, causing downtime. Mitigation strategies include rolling deployments or using redundant servers.

Cannot scale with high traffic: The current configuration may struggle with increased traffic. Addressing scalability could involve load balancing, horizontal scaling (adding more servers), or leveraging cloud services.
